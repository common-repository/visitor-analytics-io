### HOW OTHER PEOPLE USE TWIPLA

See where people come from with **Traffic Structure**. Is it direct visits, organic search, social media? That shows where to focus your marketing time and money.

Spot trends and changes by comparing week over week, month over month, or any custom date ranges.

> <strong>Simple App. Very easy to use for beginners.</strong><br />
> "I tried learning Google Analytics, but it did not show the specifics of the traffic... at least not with my limited abilities. It did not show each viewer and what they did specifically. It had very general readings. It would only show the country where your viewers were from. That does not help much if you only do business in the U.S. <br>
> This app shows the specific city or town and exactly which pages each specific visitor visited and how long they stayed on each page specifically. I really like this app. Anyone can understand what they are looking at when they open this app."<br>
